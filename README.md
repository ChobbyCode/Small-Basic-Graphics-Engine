PGL is just a small project I worked on a while ago. I don't plan to **Update** it any more

- In that file a Console should open just click enter
- Then click the button titled New Project **Close** That Window
- Open Small Basic Editor A Navigate To Repos And Open The Just Made Project 

##Usage

Create A Sprite By:
```
X = 300
Y = 300
Z = 1
object = "square"
NewSprite()
```

Type this in the allocated space for code

You can also draw normal shapes such as
```
DrawSquare()
```
